# Factorio-Prime-Intergalactic-Delivery
A shopping point and GUI for buying those personal items with Factorio coins.


Details
-----------

- Factorio coins need to be aquired through other mods and can then be spent with this mod.
- Designed for use with Item Delivery Pod mod to make item delivery a bit more explosive. However, will work in a simplier mod without this, delivering to an output chest.

Random Notes
-------------

- Only supports the default navius surface at present.
- Coins added as a requestable item to player and logistic filters.
